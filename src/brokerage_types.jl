    BrokerageResult{T}

Result type for Gould-Fernandez brokerage analysis.

Parametric type that preserves the element type of group assignments for type stability.

# Type Parameter
- `T`: Element type of group assignments (e.g., String, Symbol, Int, CategoricalValue)

# Fields
- `coordinator::Vector{Int}`: Within-group brokerage counts (g(ego) = g(i) = g(j))
- `gatekeeper::Vector{Int}`: Gatekeeper counts (g(ego) = g(j) ≠ g(i))
- `representative::Vector{Int}`: Representative counts (g(ego) = g(i) ≠ g(j))
- `liaison::Vector{Int}`: Liaison counts (g(i) = g(j) ≠ g(ego))
- `cosmopolitan::Vector{Int}`: Cosmopolitan counts (all groups distinct)
- `total::Vector{Int}`: Total brokerage counts for each node
- `groups::Vector{T}`: Group assignments used in calculation (type-stable)

# Examples
```julia
# String groups
br = brokerage(g, ["Sales", "Sales", "Eng"])
# typeof(br) == BrokerageResult{String}
# br.groups is Vector{String} (type-stable!)

# Symbol groups
br = brokerage(g, [:A, :B, :C])
# typeof(br) == BrokerageResult{Symbol}

# Integer groups
br = brokerage(g, [1, 1, 2])
# typeof(br) == BrokerageResult{Int64}

# CategoricalArray groups
using CategoricalArrays
br = brokerage(g, categorical(["Sales", "Eng"]))
# typeof(br) == BrokerageResult{CategoricalValue{String, UInt32}}
```

    BrokerageResult(n::Int, groups::AbstractVector{T}) where T

Construct a BrokerageResult with all counts initialized to zero.

The element type T of the groups vector is preserved for type stability.

# Arguments
- `n::Int`: Number of nodes in graph
- `groups::AbstractVector{T}`: Group assignments of element type T

# Returns
`BrokerageResult{T}` where T is the element type of groups

# Examples
```julia
# Infers T = String
br = BrokerageResult(5, ["A", "A", "B", "B", "C"])
typeof(br)  # BrokerageResult{String}

# Infers T = Int64
br = BrokerageResult(3, [1, 2, 3])
typeof(br)  # BrokerageResult{Int64}
